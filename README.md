### Why those technologies over others ?

> I have already used Angular during my end-of-studies internship and I enjoy using it. In addition, Angular/Spring Boot is a popular combination for creating web applications, my goal is to learn how to use them while building my portfolio. For Tailwind I also used it during my end-of-study internship and I appreciate this CSS option.
